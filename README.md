How do I assemble it?

Start by putting the components into the PCB board. Make sure that the polarity of the capacitor and diode are correct. Once the components are soldered into place, connect the tip of the audio connector to the IN+ pad and the ring of the audio connector to the IN- pad. Solder a wire to the negative terminal of the vibrator motor and connect it to the M- pad. Then solder a wire from the positive terminal of the vibrator (see drawing) and solder the other end to the M+ pad on the PCB. Finally, connect your power source, +5v to the +5v pad and ground to the negative terminal of the power supply respectively. If you are using a USB cable to power the motor, strip the jacket of the USB cable and clip the white and green wires. Connect the red wire to the 5v pad and the black wire to the ground pad. Be sure to send a hot headphone amplified signal into the audio input. Low volume line level signals will be audible but will not be enough to turn the motor.

What do I use to amplify the signal?

A standard electromagnetic guitar or bass pickup within a close proximity to the vibrator will pickup the sound as though it were a guitar or bass string. You can run the signal through guitar/bass effects and into a standard guitar or bass amp.
